speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a
small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx,

<b>About TED</b>
<p>TED is an annual event where some of the world’s leading
thinkers and doers are invited to share what they are most
passionate about. “TED” stands for Technology, Entertainment,
Design — three broad subject areas that are, collectively,
shaping our future. And in fact, the event is broader still,
showcasing ideas that matter in any discipline. Attendees have
called it “the ultimate brain spa” and “a four-day journey into
the future.” The diverse audience — CEOs, scientists, creatives,
philanthropists — is almost  as extraordinary as the speakers,
who have included Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, Jane Goodall,
Frank Gehry, Paul Simon, Sir Richard Branson, Philippe Starck
and Bono.</p>
<p>TED was ﬁrst held in Monterey, California, in 1984. In 2001,
Chris Anderson’s Sapling Foundation acquired TED from its
founder, Richard Saul Wurman. In recent years, TED has expanded
to include an international conference, TEDGlobal;
media initiatives, including TED Talks and TED.com;
and the TED Prize. TED2010, “What the world Needs Now,”
will be held Springs, California.</p>
