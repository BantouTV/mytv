myTED.tv
--------

Multi-device app for TED and TEDx talks. It uses the Joshfire Framework [http://framework.joshfire.com] to be portable on any device.

It is publicly hosted on http://myted.tv/ but feel free to fork!


TEDx mode
---------

When accessed at http://myted.tv/tedx[location] (for instance http://myted.tv/tedxparis) it generates a TEDx-specific app
with only the talks for this event.

To enable this feature TEDx events must be registered in this spreadsheet :
https://spreadsheets0.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?hl=fr&hl=fr&key=0ArnpnObxnz4RdHJhSVlURUlFdk9pc09jOHkxLWRHa1E

We're impatient to get feedback on this from TEDx organizers! If there's interest we'll discuss:
 - Features (currently you can only browse and watch videos)
 - App store publishing (we won't be able to do it ourselves for the thousands of TEDx events but 
    we want to make it as simple as possible for everyone to do it themselves)
 - Anything else!


Roadmap
-------

 - Gather feedback from TED and TEDx organizers
 - Add more adapters :
   * Web (underway)
   * Android (underway)
   * Smart TVs (GoogleTV & SamsungTV underway)
   * Blackberry
   * ...
 - Switch to the official TED API when it's available (Currently we use http://github.com/joshfire/ted-api)

Running the app locally

You should map local.myted.tv on your localhost for facebook testing purposes.




Bundling the app

The app works well as a web app but you can use Phonegap [http://phonegap.com] to build native versions
for each mobile devices that you can then post on any app store.

$ fab iphone_xcode

and open the xcode project in xcode/
